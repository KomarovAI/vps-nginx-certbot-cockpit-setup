### Migration Guide v3.1 â†’ v3.2

If you're upgrading from v3.1 and experiencing the "no such table: users" error:

1. **Automatic fix (recommended):**
   ```bash
   cd /opt/marzban-deployment
   git pull origin main
   cd marzban
   ./manage.sh build
   ./manage.sh restart
   ```

2. **Manual verification:**
   ```bash
   cd /opt/marzban-deployment/marzban
   ./manage.sh logs  # Check for successful database initialization
   ./manage.sh status  # Verify panel is responding
   ```

3. **If issues persist:**
   ```bash
   cd /opt/marzban-deployment/marzban
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   ./manage.sh start
   ```

### What Changed in Database Handling:

**Before (v3.1):**
- Database initialization happened after container startup
- Race condition between app startup and DB creation
- Manual `docker exec` commands for migrations

**After (v3.2):**
- Database initialization happens in container entrypoint
- DB tables created before application starts
- Automatic fallback from alembic to SQLAlchemy if needed
- No race conditions, reliable startup every time
